\begin{abstract}
{The contribution introduces a Bernoulli-like random walk with transition
probabilities depending of its recent steps, thus implicitly depending
on the entire walk history. The main objective is its application
to modelling and then to prediction of tennis matches. The model is
applied and tested on men Grand Slam tennis tournaments since
2009. The flexibility of the model is tested thoroughly on several
datasets and the results are presented. It is shown that the model
correctly describes the majority of all matches. Finally, the model
is also used for the in-play real life betting with rather encouraging
results.}
